# Introducing Computational Practice
This unit uses the web as a carrier to provide a background view of art and design in relation to computational technology. With this unit you will learn the history of the internet as it relates to art and design as well as practical skills to create computational art of your own using web technologies.

For the first few sessions, you will need a computer with a modern web browser. We will also be taking one step at a time to setup a comprehensive development environment that will aid you in creating a final website which will form the final outcome of this unit.

Each week, you will be given a task related to the session's theme. It can be creating a simple web element to researching about a particular topic. These tasks will form the backbone of your understanding of the overall landscape of web development and software development which will aid you in creating the final outcome.

## Objectives
As part of this unit you will be exposed to:
- History of art and design in the realm of digital technology
- Existing ideas and tools behind creating work on the internet
- Best practice when developing software
- Ways to experiment with software

## Learning Outcomes
On completion of this unit you will be able to:
- LO1	Demonstrate an ability to produce computational practice (Experimentation)
- LO2	Demonstrate an ability to evaluate your computational practice
(Personal and Professional Development)
- LO3	Demonstrate an ability to situate your computational practice amongst the work of others (Communication and Presentation)

## Week 1
### Introduction
This sesion we will be introducing the overall unit including the structure and expectation of the unit. We will also begin looking at computational practice skills starting with p5.js.

## Week 2
### Guest Lecture


## Week 3
### HTML
The basic building blocks of websites are no doubt HTML, CSS and, Javascript. In this session we start by looking at HTML, what it is and what it isn't. You will also be writing your own basic HTML pages from scratch.

## Week 4
### Enriching the web experience
With the knowledge of writing HTML markup, we can use CSS to take our plain HTML pages further. With CSS, we can use Javascript to create in browser interactions. We will see how modern web pages are made and practice some of it ourselves using CSS and Javascript through p5.js.

## Week 5
### Setting up an environment and node.js
So far we have been using the p5.js web editor exclusively to create our web pages, however, as a project gets larger and more complicated, developing locally becomes more and more convenient. In this session we shall setup a local development environment while at the same time, take a peek into the world of backend development with node.js

## Week 6
### More node.js
We had an overview as well as some hands on of node.js so far, this week we shall look closer at node.js and create our first web server.

## Week 7
### Libraries and Frameworks
Almost no one writes large software applications from scratch, almost no one should.

## Week 8
### A peek inside p5.js
We have used p5.js quite extensively throughout the unit, but what goes on underneath? What can we learn from the source code of p5.js that can be applied to our own practice.

# Introducing Computational Practice
This unit uses the web as a carrier to provide a background view of art and design in relation to computational technology. With this unit you will learn the history of the internet as it relates to art and design as well as practical skills to create computational art of your own using web technologies.

For the first few sessions, you will need a computer with a modern web browser. Towards the end, we will be taking one step at a time to setup a comprehensive development environment that will aid you in creating a final website which will form the final outcome of this unit.


## Objectives
As part of this unit you will be exposed to:
- History of art and design in the realm of digital technology
- Existing ideas and tools behind creating work on the internet
- Best practice when developing software
- Ways to experiment with software

## Learning Outcomes
On completion of this unit you will be able to:
- LO1	Demonstrate an ability to produce computational practice (Experimentation)
- LO2	Demonstrate an ability to evaluate your computational practice
(Personal and Professional Development)
- LO3	Demonstrate an ability to situate your computational practice amongst the work of others (Communication and Presentation)
